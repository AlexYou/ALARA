\begin{chapter}{Validation and Benchmarking}
  
  For all new computer programs, an important step in the development
  process is the validation of the program against other computational
  tools.  In the field of fusion activation calculations, there are
  many such tools.  Both FISPACT-97\cite{FISPACT} (time-step based ODE
  solver) and DKR\cite{DKR} (no-loop Bateman solution to linear
  chains) have been shown in the past to agree well with analytical
  solutions to multi-step activation pathways\cite{IAEA.bench2.rep}.
  \ALARA\ offers improvement over DKR because it is able to accurately
  model loops in the activation trees and calculate the gas
  production.  In comparison to FISPACT-97, \ALARA\ has many
  advantages, including the ability to exactly model pulsed
  irradiation histories and simultaneously calculate the solution at
  many spatial points.  In comparison to both codes, \ALARA\ uses
  modern programming practices and data handling to increase the
  flexibility of operation and reduce memory requirements (see section
  \ref{sec:summary.modern}).

  \begin{section}{Benchmark Specifications}
  
    To validate \ALARA\ the IAEA FENDL Calculational Activation
    Benchmark\cite{IAEA.bench1.spec} problem was chosen.  This problem
    is based on the reference steel/water shielding blanket design in
    the ITER outline design.  This design includes:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item a copper first wall with beryllium coating
    \item shielding blanket with alternating layers of stainless steel
      (316 SS) and water
    \item a double wall Inconel 625 vacuum vessel with a water-cooled
      steel pebble bed and a back shield made of lead and boron carbide
    \item an inboard magnet, including conductors and insulators.
    \end{itemize}
    With such a wide range of materials, the design offers an
    extensive test of the activation code's capabilities.
    
    The neutron fluxes have been provided by the benchmark in the
    VITAMIN-J 175 group energy structure for each of the 468 fine mesh
    intervals.  These fluxes were calculated using the
    ONEDANT\cite{ONEDANT} deterministic neutron transport code with a
    14.1 MeV isotropic neutron source normalized to inboard and
    outboard neutron wall loadings of 1 and 1.5 MW/m$^2$,
    respectively.
    
    Version 2.0 of the IAEA Fusion Evaluated Nuclear Data Library for
    Activation (FENDL/A 2.0) and for Decay (FENDL/D 2.0) were used for
    all calculations, ensuring that difference in the results were due
    to the activation codes themselves and not the nuclear data.
    
    The first activation calculations were performed with a steady
    state operation time of 3 years and cooling times of 1 hour, 1
    day, 1 week, 30 days, 1 year and 100 years.  A pulsed activation
    calculation was also performed using 94500 pulses of 1000 s with a
    dwell time of 1200 s between pulses.
  \end{section}
  
  \begin{section}{Steady-State Problem}
    
    In \ALARA\, this calculation built 109 reaction trees with a total
    of 32023 nodes and a longest chain of length 14, producing 603
    different isotopes in the steel-containing intervals, of which 402
    were radioactive.  The truncation tolerance was $10^{-4}$ and the
    ignore tolerance, $10^{-6}$.
    
    The results have been compared by calculating the relative
    difference between \ALARA\ and the other codes:
    $$\mbox{Relative Difference} = \frac{\mbox{\ALARA}}{\mbox{X}} - 1,$$
    where X is either FISPACT-97 or DKR.

      \end{center}
    \end{figure}
    
    Figures \ref{fig:rel.diff.ss.1} and \ref{fig:rel.diff.ss.2} show
    the relative difference between the results of the steady state
    problem from \ALARA\ and FISPACT-97 and between \ALARA\ and DKR at
    a cooling time of 1 hour and 1 century, respectively.
    
    At a cooling time of 1 hour, the \ALARA\ results are within 1.8\%
    of the FISPACT-97 results throughout the entire geometry, with
    most zones having a difference of less than 0.4\%.  The largest
    differences occur in the 14 water-filled zones of the blanket,
    increasing in directions away from the plasma in the zones with
    lower and softer fluxes.
    
    At a cooling time of 1 century, the differences between \ALARA\ 
    and FISPACT-97 are as high as 2.5\%, with the largest differences
    still occurring in the water-filled zones where, after more than 8
    tritium half-lives, the dominant isotope is now $^{14}$C.  The
    differences in the other zones remain below 0.4\%.
    
    The results from these comparisons immediately demonstrate some of
    the differences in the methods of the various activation codes.
    In most zones, the \ALARA\ results are within a fraction of a
    percent of the FISPACT-97 values.  In the water-filled zones,
    alternating with the steel in the inboard and outboard blanket,
    the total activity was greatly underestimated.  Further
    investigation shows that the activity is dominated by tritium and
    $^{14}$C, and that their relative production levels are as low as
    $5 \times 10^{-12}$ and $3 \times 10^{-9}$, respectively.  It is
    clear that this level of accuracy is not sufficient for these
    zones.  On the other hand, increasing the accuracy for the whole
    problem would dramatically increase the size of the activation
    trees in all the other zones.  While this demonstrates the
    limitations of a problem-wide truncation tolerance, it requires
    little effort to perform a second \ALARA\ calculation.  A second
    calculation was performed for this problem using $10^{-10}$ for
    both the truncation and ignore tolerances.  Figures
    \ref{fig:rel.diff.ss.1} and \ref{fig:rel.diff.ss.2} are based on
    these values in the odd numbered zones between 11 and 23 and
    between 33 and 45, inclusively.
    
    DKR had an even more drastic problem with zones where the specific
    activity was dominated by tritium.  Since the methods implemented
    in this version of DKR were not designed to compute the
    accumulation of light ions ($^1$H, $^2$H, $^3$H, $^3$He, and
    $^4$He) emitted by nuclear reactions, the major source of tritium,
    its total activity for all zones with dominant tritium inventories
    is much too small.  Since these differences were up to a few
    orders of magnitude, the relative difference between \ALARA\ and
    DKR in these zones has not been shown in figure
    \ref{fig:rel.diff.ss.1} in order to compare the differences in the
    other zones.  The magnitude of these differences can be inferred,
    however, from figure \ref{fig:rel.diff.ss.2}, where it must be
    noted that 1 century is over 8 tritium half-lives.  The
    undercalculation of tritium in these zones is so great that even
    after more than 99.6\% of the tritium has decayed, the error is
    still a few percent.
    
    In those zones with insignificant tritium inventories, the
    differences between \ALARA\ and DKR are less than 0.2\% throughout
    the geometry at a cooling time of 1 hour.  After 1 century, even
    though the relative contribution of tritium has increased in some
    of those same zones, the relative differences are still less than
    1\%.  DKR's inability to account for the light ion production
    results in tritium inventories which are as much as 6 orders of
    magnitude too low in the first wall's Be coating, and up to 3
    times too low in the blanket's water cooled zones.  Even after
    more than 8 tritium half-lives (1 century), when tritium is
    responsible for less than 10\% of the total activity, the
    difference between \ALARA\ and DKR in the water can be as high as
    7\% (zone \#33).  This discrepancy demonstrates why the modeling
    of light ion accumulation is one of the base features for any new
    activation code.
    
    A single fine mesh interval was chosen in which to compare the
    activity of various nuclides in detail.  The 1 mm thick stainless
    steel (SS316) inboard first wall back plate is modeled as a single
    interval (\#242) in zone \#24.  The large number of initial
    isotopes in steel and the high flux due to its proximity to the
    plasma make this a good choice for comparison.
    
    Table \ref{tab:detail.1} shows the seven most dominant isotopes at
    a cooling time of 1 hour, which together account for over 95\% of
    the total activity.  Table \ref{tab:detail.2} shows the five most
    dominant isotopes at a cooling time of 1 century, accounting for
    more than 99.7\% of the total activity.

    The agreement between \ALARA\ and FISPACT-97 is seen to be within
    1\% in all cases.  DKR, on the other hand, has relative
    differences of up to 16\%.  These discrepancies are most probably
    caused by the inability of DKR to model certain kinds of loops in
    the decay chains and the influence which this has on the decay
    chain creation calculations.
    
  \end{section}

  \begin{section}{Pulsing Problem\label{sec:valid.pulse}}
    
    The results of \ALARA\ and DKR for the pulsing problem are
    compared in Figure \ref{fig:rel.diff.p.1} for both 1 hour and 1
    century.  There are no results for FISPACT-97 as it was unable to
    solve the exact pulsing problem in a reasonable amount of time.
    Based on the time (14 minutes) required to solve the first 100
    pulses at a single spatial point, FISPACT-97 was determined to be
    unsuited to such pulsed operation calculations.  Assuming that the
    total computation time scales linearly with the number of pulses,
    the full problem would require more than 220 days for each of the
    317 spatial points -- a total computation time of over 190 years!
    
    Once again, tritium plays an important role in the discrepancies,
    which are nearly identical to the discrepancies between \ALARA\ 
    and DKR for the steady state problem.  In the glass insulator of
    the TF coil (zone \#3), the discrepancy in the pulsing problem is
    twice as high as in the steady state problem at 1 hour, but the
    same at 1 century.  This demonstrates the true physical effect of
    pulsing on the importance of the tritium inventory at relatively
    short cooling times, even though the tritium inventory itself is
    not significantly affected by the pulsed history.  
    
    The pulsed operation will tend to reduce the inventory of isotopes
    with half-lives which are of the same order of magnitude as the
    dwell time between pulses: very long-lived isotopes will decay
    little between pulses and slowly reach their saturation level
    while very short-lived isotopes will decay completely between
    pulses, but can reach their saturation level in a single
    pulse\cite{Pulsar}.  The dominant isotopes in the glass at 1 hour
    are $^{64}$Cu and $^{24}$Na, both with half-lives slightly longer
    than half a day.  Their inventories in the pulsed problem are 50\%
    less than in the steady state problem, while the tritium inventory
    is reduced by less than 10\%.  Thus, the fraction of the total
    activity from tritium is increased, even though the tritium
    inventory itself goes down.

    \begin{figure}[htbp]
      \begin{center}
        \epsfig{file=eps/pulse_final.eps,height=\textwidth,angle=-90}
        \caption{Relative difference between \ALARA\  and DKR for
          the pulsing problem at cooling times of 1 hour and 1 century.}
        \label{fig:rel.diff.p.1}
      \end{center}
    \end{figure}
    
    One method of modeling a pulsed problem as a steady state problem
    is to preserve both the total fluence and the total operating
    time\cite{Pulsar,hosny,qingming}.  Using ALARA, the results of
    such an approximate calculation with a flux scaling factor of
    1/2.2 and total operation time of 2.079 $\times$ 10$^8$ are
    compared to the exact solution in Figure
    \ref{fig:rel.diff.approx}, represented as
    $$\mbox{Relative Difference} = \frac{\mbox{Pulsing}}{\mbox{Steady
        State}} - 1.$$
    In this case, because of the nature of the
    pulsing history, the effect can only be seen at short cooling
    times.  As discussed above, the effect of the pulses is greatest
    for isotopes with half-lives of roughly the same order of
    magnitude as the dwell time between pulses.  Thus the effect
    decays away within a few ``dwell times'' of shutdown.
    
    The two materials with largest discrepancies are the glass
    insulator (zone \#3) and the first wall heat sink (Cu-Be-Ni in
    zones \#25 and \#31).  In the former, the activity of $^{28}$Al
    (t$_{1/2}$ = 2.25 m), responsible for over 25\% of the activity at
    a cooling time of 1 minute, is under-calculated in the
    steady-state approximation by 50\%.  The same is true of $^{66}$Cu
    (t$_{1/2}$ = 5.10 m) which is responsible for just under 10\% of
    the activity in the first wall.

  \end{section}

  \begin{section}{Advanced Features}
  
    It is not possible to validate \ALARA's complex schedule modeling
    or reverse calculation mode through comparison to other codes
    because these features are unique to \ALARA.  With \ALARA's
    standard features validated against these other codes, however, it
    is possible to construct test problems for \ALARA's advanced
    features which can be formulated within the limits of the standard
    features.

    \begin{subsection}{Complex Schedule Modeling}
    
      With the standard single pulsing history capabilities validated
      against DKR in section \ref{sec:valid.pulse}, it is possible to
      construct a number of complex pulsing schedules which
      technically reduce to the same pulsing schedule as the IAEA
      Benchmark problem.  Four such reformulations, with increasing
      complexities, have been tested and compared to the results of
      the normal pulsing problem.
    
      The first formulation splits the 94500 pulses into two groups of
      47250 pulses, and a delay of 1200 s after the first group of
      pulses.  The next formulation uses four groups of pulses of
      23625 pulses with 1200 s delay after each of the first 3 groups.
      The third formulation increases the number of levels in the
      schedule hierarchy.  The top level schedule has two
      sub-schedules.  Each sub-schedule is repeated 100 times, with
      1200 s delay after the first sub-schedule.  The first
      sub-schedule has two pulsing groups, each with 250 pulses and
      separated by a 1200 s delay.  The second sub-schedule has two
      groups of pulses with 225 and 220 pulses respectively.  The
      total number of pulses is again $\left[ 100 \times ( 250 + 250)
        + 100 \times (225 + 220) \right] = 94500$.  The last
      formulation is the most complicated.  The top level schedule
      again has two sub-schedules.  The first sub-schedule is repeated
      10 times and consists of a block of 2500 pulses followed by a
      1200 s delay and then another sub-schedule, which in turn
      consists of two blocks of 125 pulses, and is repeated 10 times.
      The second sub-schedule is repeated 100 times and has one block
      of 445 pulses.  Summing the entire schedule gives $\left[ 10
        \times ( 2500 + 10 \times (125 + 125)) + 100 \times 445\right]
      = 94500$ pulses.
    
      After the complete solution of all four problems, the only
      difference amongst the results was the length of time taken to
      calculate them (using the unix program 'diff' on both the output
      files and tree files showed no difference).  This is logical
      since increasing the complexity of the schedule increases both
      the number of matrices which must be created and the number of
      matrix calculations required to combine their effects into the
      whole schedule.
      
    \end{subsection}
    
    \begin{subsection}{Reverse Calculation}
    
      In order to test the reverse calculation mode, it is sufficient
      to formulate a problem which targets isotopes known to be
      created by the forward calculation.  Since steel is the most
      prevalent material in the IAEA Benchmark, the 4 most significant
      (in terms of specific activity) isotopes were chosen as targets
      in the steel mixtures: $^{51}$Cr, $^{54}$Mn, $^{55}$Fe, and
      $^{57}$Co.  With the goal being to determine the production of
      these isotopes from steel, all zones without stainless steel 316
      were changed to ``void'' to reduce the computational time.
      
      The shutdown inventories for these four isotopes were identical
      to those of the forward calculation and table
      \ref{tab:valid.reverse} shows the source of each target isotope.

  \begin{section}{Computing Resources}
    

    For the steady-state and pulsing code comparison, all three codes
    were used on the same IBM RS/6000 Model 595 P2SC workstation.  The
    full steady-state problem was solved by \ALARA\ in 3425 s
    (57$^m$5$^s$) and by DKR in 5253 s (1$^h$27$^m$33$^s$).  The same
    problem required 20715 s (5$^h$36$^m$25$^s$) for a previously
    developed shell-script system which sequentially runs FISPACT-97
    for each of the intervals.  The pulsed problem was solved by
    \ALARA\ in 5736 s (1$^h$35$^m$36$^s$), with 44591 nodes and a
    longest chain of 14.  DKR needed 10855 s (3$^h$0$^m$55$^s$).
    FISPACT-97 was unable to solve the pulsed problem.
    
    For the steady state problem, \ALARA\ requires a maximum of 35 MB
    of RAM and, other than the binary library of just over 11 MB, uses
    no hard drive space.  DKR required as much as 107 MB of RAM and up
    to 250 MB of temporary hard drive space in addition to its 10 MB
    text library.  Other than the 38 MB data libraries, FISPACT-97
    uses negligible quantities of RAM and hard drive space since it
    solves each interval sequentially.
    
    For the advanced feature validation, a complete set of problems
    was run on the development platform, an Intel P166MMX based
    machine running the Linux 2.0.30 operating systme.  Table
    \ref{tab:valid.runtime} shows the time required for each problem.

  \begin{section}{Conclusions}
    
    The \ALARA\ activation code has been validated for use in
    calculating the activation of fusion power systems.  The results
    for a steady state activation problem have been compared to the
    results from two standard codes whose accuracy has been well
    documented\cite{IAEA.bench2.rep}: FISPACT-97 and DKR.
    Discrepancies between the total activities calculated by \ALARA\ 
    and the other codes are always less than 2.5\%, except where DKR
    is unable to calculate the tritium production from emitted light
    ions.  The results of a pulsing problem have been compared to DKR
    (FISPACT-97 was unable to perform such a calculation in a
    reasonable time).  The discrepancies in this case are once again
    primarily due to the lack of tritium production in DKR, and are
    otherwise less than 1\%.
    
    Based on this validation and its faster and less memory-intensive
    operation, \ALARA\ is recommended for the solution of fusion
    activation problems.
