<h1>Users' Guide for ALARA:</h1>
<h3>Analytic and Laplacian Adaptive Radioactivity Analysis</h3>
<hr>
</center>

The primary purpose of <b>ALARA</b> is to calculate the
induced activation caused by neutron irradiation throughout a nuclear
system (including fission reactors, fusion reactors, and
accelerators).<p>

This Developers' Guide will describe the source code and structure of
<b>ALARA</b>, serving as a guide to those who will continue
development of <b>ALARA</b>.<p>

<h3>Language and Disclaimer</h3>

Although <b>ALARA</b> has been written in <tt>C++</tt>, the project
served as a learning exercise for both <tt>C++</tt> and
object-oriented programming.  Thus, while a great deal of effort was
made to write well designed object-oriented code, as of this writing,
the author has had no confirmation that this was successful.
Nevertheless, it is recommended that all additions to <b>ALARA</b> be
implemented with as much effort as possible to continue improving its
design.
