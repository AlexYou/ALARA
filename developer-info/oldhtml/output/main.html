<a name="stdout"><center><h3>Standard Output</h3></center></a>

<b>ALARA</b> output is always written to the standard output of the
system in question.  The standard methods of your system should be
used to capture this output to a file, if desired.  A sample output is
available <a href=../samples/1/index.html target=_top>here</a>.
<p>

As described in the section on <a href=../cmd/main.html>command-line
arguments</a>, various levels of output are available during the
calculation.  The part of the output file will contain this verbose
output, including confirmation of the input data and details of the
cross-referencing and preprocessing of the input.
<p>

The second part of the output file shows details on the tree building
process, ranging from a simple list of the root isotopes being solved
and statistics on the size and speed of the solution, to details on
the chain growth and truncation calculations (depending on the
verbosity specified on the <a href=../cmd/main.html>command-line</a>).
<p>


The final part of the output file are the results, as requested by the
user in the input file.  This output will include one section for each
output format description given by the user.  Each of these sections
will be divided into blocks as shown in the following block diagram.

<table border=2 cellpadding=10 align=center><tr><td>

<p>

<a name="type1"><b>Table type 1</b></a>
<p>

The first type has a row for each isotope produced in the problem that
has a non-zero response.  If the <tt>constituent</tt> keyword is given
in the <tt>output</tt> block, there will be one table for each
constituent, followed by a table for the total mixture.
<p>

For the isotopic results of individual mixture constituents, all the
values are normalized to the volume fraction of that constituent.
Therefore, the table represents the results for a sample made up
entirely of that constituent.  Put another way, the table represents
the results normalized per unit volume (or mass) containing only that
constituent.  <p>

For most results, the table containing the total isotopic results for
the interval, zone, or mixture, is not normalized, and these values
represent the result for the mixture as described in the input,
regardless of what volume fraction if filled.  However, for tables
showing the total waste disposal rating (or clearance index) of
intervals, zones, or mixtures, all the values are normalized by the
total volume fraction of the mixture.  Therefore, the table represents
the results for a 100% dense sample made up of the same composition
as the mixture.
<p>

<a name="type2"><b>Table type 2</b></a>
<p>

The second type of table has a row for each point in the requested
resolution, giving the total response at that point.  These results
are normalized as described in the previous paragraph (ie.  only the
waste disposal rating results are normalized).
<p>
<b>Note:</b> For reverse calculations, the entire structure defined above
will be repeated for each target isotope.

<a name="tree"><hr></a>
<center><h3>Tree File</h3></center>

<b>ALARA</b> also <a href=../cmd/main.html>optionally</a> produces a
so-called tree file to allow some rudimentary pathway analysis.  The
tree file contains much information about the creation and truncation
of the trees and chains used to calculate the transmutation and
activation in the problem.
<p>

One tree will be created for each initial isotope.  All the
information given for this isotope is based on the flux chosen for the
truncation calculations of this isotope, namely, the group-wise
maximum flux across all the intervals in which the initial isotope
exists.  An entry for an isotope in the tree will look like this:

<blockquote><tt>-(na)->h-3 - (0.00306937)</tt></blockquote>

The level of indentation indicates the rank of this isotope in
the tree.  This can be best seen by viewing the whole file and
noting the line's relative indentation.  The information given
in such an entry is as follows:
<p>

<dl>

  <dt><b>reaction type: <tt>(na)</tt></b> This indicates the reaction type(s).

  <dd> If multiple reactions lead to this product, the reactions will
       be separated by commas.  The information indicates the emitted
       particles only.  Therefore, in this example, the reaction is an
       (n,na) reaction.  Generally, standard symbols are used, such as
       'n' for neutrons, 'a' for alpha particles, 'p','d','t' for the
       three isotopes of hydrogen, respectively, and 'h' for
       helium-3. For all neutron reactions, an additional '*' is used
       to indicate that the product is in an excited isomeric state.
       Finally, for decay reactions the symbol '*D' is used.
       <p>

  <dt><b>product nuclide: <tt>h-3</tt></b> The product isotope's chemical
       symbol and atomic number.

  <dd> In cases where the product is in an isomeric state, this will
       be followed by a letter (m,n,...)  indicating which isomeric
       state.
       <p>

  <dt><b>truncation mode: -</b> This single character indicates the
       result of the truncation calculation at this node.
  <dd> There are four possible results as follows:
       <dl>
	 <dt><b>-</b>
	 <dd> This code indicates that the chain continues
	      normally because this isotope passed all the tests.
	 <dt><b>*</b>
	 <dd> This code indicates that only the radioactive
	      decays of the chain will be followed after this node.
	      This arises when the production does not pass the
	      truncation tolerance test, but ensures that the result
	      includes all the radioactive products.  Stable products
	      which are descendants of this node may be calculated if
	      they themselves pass the ignore tolerance test.
	 <dt><b>/</b>
	 <dd> This code indicates that the chain will be fully
	      truncated at this node, and the result will include this
	      node.  This arises when the node is a stable isotope and
	      does not pass the truncation tolerance test, but does
	      pass the ignore tolerance test.
	 <dt><b>&lt;</b>
	 <dd> This code indicates that the chain will be fully
	      truncated at this node and will <i>not</i> be included
	      in the result.  This arises when the production of this
	      nuclide does not pass either the truncation or the
	      ignore tolerance test.
       </dl>
       <p>

  <dt><b>truncation production: <tt>(0.00306937)</tt> </b> This
       indicates the relative production at the end of operation of
       this nuclide from the initial isotope during the truncation
       calculation.
  <dd> As explained in the <b>ALARA</b> Technical Manual], this
       represents the total production of this nuclide during the
       whole problem, assuming that none of it is transmuted or decays
       further.  If this production is not calculated, for example,
       because the chain is only being followed on radioactive
       reactions and this nuclide is stable, then this entry will be
       '-'.
</dl>
      
<a name="gamma"><hr></a>
<center><h3>Gamma Source File</h3></center>

The gamma source files created by <b>ALARA</b> currently has a very
simple (if not unweildy) format.  This file is only created if the
<tt>photon_src</tt> option is used in one of the <tt>output</tt>
blocks of the input file where the filename is also given.  The
spatial resolution of this file is that specified by the
<tt>output</tt> block.
<p>

For each spatial region, there is a section for each isotope
responsible for gamma emissions and a section for the total gamma
emissions.  Each of these sections has a header line consisting of the
isotope's identifier (chemical symbol and mass number) or the keyword
"TOTAL", respectively.  Within each section, there is one block of
gamma source values for each output time, that is, one for shutdown
and one for each cooling time.  Finally, each of these blocks contains
the group-wise gamma source values in photons per second, arranged in
lines of 6 values per line.
