<blockquote>
<tt>alara [-h] [-r] [-t <i>&lt;tree_filename&gt;</i>] [-v <i>&lt;n&gt;</i>]
[<i>&lt;input_filename&gt;</i>]<p>
alara -V</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>

<dl>
<dt> <tt><b>-h</b></tt>: print a short help message describing
     the command-line usage
     <p>
     
<dt> <tt><b>-r</b></tt>: operate in a post-processing mode
<dd> This option is used to redo the built-in post-processing stage of
     <b>ALARA</b>, possibly calculating different responses than in
     the original run.  <b>ALARA</b> creates a dump file during
     operation which contains enough information to calculate
     different output responses for the same problem.  This option can
     only be used after <b>ALARA</b> has already been successfully
     run.  To use this option, you must use the same problem
     description (ie: the same input file) as the original run, and
     can only change the output blocks.
     <p>
     If, for example, the original <b>ALARA</b> run only gave results
     for the specific activity, and the user is now interested in
     results for decay heat and/or a consituent break-down.  The user
     could change the output block of the
     <a href=../input/index.html target=_top>input file</a> (or add a
     new output block) to include the newly desired results and then
     rerun <b>ALARA</b> using this restart option.
     <p>
<dt> <tt><b>-t <i>&lt;tree_filename&gt;</i></b></tt>: set the filename
     for the tree file
<dd> This option defines the name of the optional tree file to be
     generated during the <b>ALARA</b> run.  If it already exists,
     this file will be overwritten.  For more information on tree
     files, see the Users' Guide section devoted to <a
     href=../output/main.html>output files</a>.
     <p>

<dt> <tt><b>-V</b></tt>: show version string
<dd> This option will show the current version string and stop!
     <p>

<dt> <tt><b>-v <i>&lt;n&gt;</i></b></tt>: set the verbosity level of
     the output
<dd> This option is used to determine how much output is generated by
     <b>ALARA</b>.  Normally, <b>ALARA</b> will only generate output
     for the results requested in an output block.  Using this option,
     you can increase the level of output given during the calculation
     itself.  The level is set using an interger argument,
     <tt><i>&lt;n&gt;</i></tt>:
     <p>
     <table border=2 cellpadding=5>
       <tr><td>1</td><td>Shows top-level program phase
	    (e.g. input/solution/output)</td></tr>
       <tr><td>2</td><td>Shows second level program phase
	    (e.g. reading input/cross-checking input/preprocessing input
	    ...)</td></tr>
       <tr><td><b><i>3</i></b></td><td><b><i>This is the recommended
	    level.</i></b> Shows fine level program phase, including
	    basic echoing of input and basic statistics on the
	    solution status. </td></tr>
       <tr><td>4-6</td><td>Increased verbosity gives more information
	    in input processing and more solution statistics.  During
	    input processing, this includes expansion of materials
	    and calculation of interval volumes, and during the
	    solution, this includes information about each node being
	    added to the trees, their library status and truncation
	    status.</td></tr>
     </table>
     <p>

<dt> <tt><b><i>&lt;input_filename&gt;</i></b></tt>: define the
     <a href=../input/index.html target=_top>input file</a>
<dd> This option defines which <a href=input.html>input file</a> will
     be used.  If not name is given, the input will be read from
     <tt><b>stdin</b></tt>.
