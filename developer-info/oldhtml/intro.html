<h1>Users' Guide for ALARA:</h1>
<h3>Analytic and Laplacian Adaptive Radioactivity Analysis</h3>
<hr>
</center>

The primary purpose of <b>ALARA</b> is to calculate the
induced activation caused by neutron irradiation throughout a nuclear
system (including fission reactors, fusion reactors, and
accelerators).<p>

The usage of <b>ALARA</b> is fairly straightforward, requiring little
knowledge of the code's inner workings.  This Users' Guide, however
does assume that the reader is familiar with the basic problem of
induced activation.  Background on induced activation, and details on
<b>ALARA</b>'s can be found in [ref. 1].  This reference will also
help ensure that <b>ALARA</b> is well-suited to the problems that you
are trying to solve.<p>
  
This Users' Guide will describe the command-line options of
<b>ALARA</b>, input file structure and the basic support files
necessary to run <b>ALARA</b>.
