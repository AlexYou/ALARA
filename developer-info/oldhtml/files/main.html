<center><h3>Element Library</h3></center>

The element library allows the user to define the isotopic abundances
to be used for each element.  While this library should normally
include a definition of the natural abundances for each element, an
extension is available for defining enriched or isotopically tailored
elements.
<p>

An element library can contain an arbitrary number of elemental
definitions, each represented by a block with the following format.
Every block must start with the following five entries:
<ul>
  <li> a string indicating the name/identifier,
  <li> a floating point value for the molar mass,
  <li> an integer value for the atomic number,
  <li> a floating point value for the theoretical density, and
  <li> an integer value defining the number of isotopes.
</ul>
This is followed by two entries for each of these isotopes:
<ul>
  <li> an integer value for the mass number, and
  <li> a floating point value for the atomic abundance, in %. 
</ul>
<p>

<b>Naming Elemental Definitions</b>
<p>

The names/identifiers for all elemental definitions must be derived
from the chemical symbol for that element, using the format
<tt>ZZ[:AAA...]</tt>, where <tt>ZZ</tt> represents the chemcial
symbol, and <tt>[:AAA...]</tt> represents an optional modifier,
separated by a colon, '<tt>:</tt>', from the chemical symbol.  By
convention, entries without modifiers are used to define the natural
abundances of isotopes.  The modifier must be a character string
containing no whitespace.  [example: a definition for lithium enriched
to 90% in the isotope <sup>6</sup>Li, might have the name 'Li:90'.]
These names/identifiers can be used both in a <tt>mixture</tt> block
of the input file (when defining a constituent of type
<tt>element</tt>) and in the material library.

<center><h3>Material Library</h3></center>

The material library is a mechanism for allowing users to save and
re-use the definitons of a set of materials.  Users are encouraged to
develop their own material libraries, by adding material definitions
to them as needed.  Material libraries are all defined as lists of
elemental definitions, each of which must occur in the <a
href=#elelib>element library</a>.
<p>

A material library can contain an arbitrary number of material
definitions, each represented by a block with the following format.
Every block must start with the following three entries:
<ul>
  <li> a string indicating the name/identifier,
  <li> a floating point value for the theoretical density, and
  <li> an integer defining the number of elemental definitions.
</ul>
This is followed by three entries for each elemental definition:
<ul>
  <li> a string indicating the name/identifier,
  <li> a floating point value for the weight fraction in %, and
  <li> an integer for the atomic number.
</ul>
<p>

<b>Naming Material Definitions</b>
<p>

The name of a material definition must be a character string with no
whitespace.  The recommended practice is that material definitions
never be deleted from a material library, ensuring the repeatability
of results.  It is expected, however, that many materials will undergo
variations in their definition over time.  It is therefore recommended
that each material be named with a very specific identifier, perhaps
containing dates, references, or project names.  This will allow a
single material library to be a growing and complete record of the
material definitions used over time.

<center><h3>Waste Disposal Rating/Clearance Index</h3></center>

Waste disposal ratings and clearance indices are used to provide a
single metric for classifying the level of control required when
disposing of used material.  Each metric is based on a (possibly)
unique list of isotopes and the allowable specific activities for
those isotopes.
<p>

The WDR/CI files contain the disposal limit expressed as either a
volumetric or specific activity.  These files are simple text files
containing one pair for each isotope for which a limit exists.  The
first entry of each pair identifies the isotope using either the
standard chemical symbol notation <tt>CC-AAAM</tt> (<tt>CC</tt> is the
chemical symbol, <tt>AAA</tt> is the mass number, and <tt>M</tt> is
the isomeric state: 'm' for the first isomeric state, 'n' for the
second, and so on), or <b>ALARA</b>'s kza notation <tt>ZZAAAM</tt>
(<tt>ZZ</tt> is the atomic number, <tt>AAA</tt> is the mass number,
and <tt>M</tt> is the numerical isomeric state: '1' for the first
state, '2' for the second, etc).  The second entry is a specific
activity in any combination of units supported by <b>ALARA</b>.  The
user is responsible for ensuring that the units chose in the
<tt>output</tt> block match the units in the waste disposal limit
file(s) used in that same block.

<center><h3>Binary Reaction Library</h3></center>

Because the reaction schemes/chains are created by a depth first
search using the data from the transmutation and decay libraries,
these libraries need to be accessed extensively and randomly.  In the
past, such random access was not possible due to limits on mass
storage devices.  Currently, in a text format, such random access
would still be very tedious.  To ensure that this random access does
not create a drag on <b>ALARA</b>, it is necessary to either store the
entire library in memory or use a binary file format.  Because the
libraries are often quite large (many MB) a simple binary format was
designed. 
<p>

For more information, see the section on binary reaction libraries in
the Developers' Guide.
