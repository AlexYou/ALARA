<h3>ALARA Users' Guide</h3>
<h1>Input File Syntax</h3>
<hr>
</center>

The input file for <b>ALARA</b> has been designed to ensure that the
input information is easy to understand, edit and comment.  This is
possible by using a very free format permitting comments, blank lines,
inclusion of other files, and arbitrary ordering of the input
information.  After reading the full input file, <b>ALARA</b> performs
various cross-checks and cross-references to ensure that the input
data is self-consistent.  It then goes on to pre-process the data for
the calculation.  Every attempt has been made to give useful <a
href=errmsg.html>error messages</a> when the data is not consistent.

<h3>General</h3>

There are many possible input block types.  These blocks can appear in
any order and many blocks can occur more than once, if at all.  One
block type, <tt><a href=#convert_lib>convert_lib</a></tt>, is only
used to convert data library formats, and will cause <b>ALARA</b> to
halt if used in an input file.  Each of the input blocks includes a
link to a sample block, as it exists in a complete <a
href=../samples/1/index.html target=_top>sample input file</a>.
<p>

In the following list, input blocks indicated in bold are required at
least once in every input file:

<a name=note1>[1]</a> Either the
<tt><a href=#dimension>dimension</a></tt> or the
<tt><a href=#volumes>volumes</a></tt> is required, but it will
generate an error if both are included.

<p>

Not all input blocks are required, with some having default values and
others being unnecessary for certain problems.  There are also some
input blocks which are incompatible with each other.  While
superfluous input blocks may go unnoticed (there are occasional
warnings), incompatible input blocks will create an error.
<p>

Most input blocks allow the user to define their own symbolic names
for cross-referencing the various input data.  Any string of
characters can be used as long as its does not contain any whitespace
(spaces, tabs, new-lines, etc.).  It is considered dangerous, however,
to use a keyword as a symbolic name.  If the input file is correct, it
will function properly, but if there are errors in the input file, the
usage of keywords as symbolic names may make the error message
irrelevant.  The keywords include those listed in the above list and
the keyword "end".  While many input blocks of fixed length require
nothing to indicate the end of the block, some blocks have a variable
length and require the keyword "end" to terminate the block.
<p>

Some input elements represent times and can be defined in a number of
different units.  When this is the case, the floating point time value
should be followed by a single character representing the following
units:
<p>

<center>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>[s]econd</tt></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>[m]inute</tt></td><td>60 seconds</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>[h]our</tt></td><td>60 minutes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>[d]ay</tt></td><td>24 hours</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>[w]eek</tt></td><td>7 days</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>[y]ear</tt></td><td>52 weeks</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>[c]entury}</tt></td><td>100 years</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>

One input file can be included in another with the <tt>#include</tt>
directive, similar to the C programming language.  Any number of files
can be included, and included files can also contain directives to
include other files.  The only restriction is that the inclusion must
not occur within an input block!
<p>

All other lines in which the first non-space character is the pound
sign (or number sign) (#) are considered as comments.  Comments can
also be used after any single word input (an input value with no
whitespace) by using the same comment character (#).  Such comments
extend to the end of the current line.  Blank lines are permitted
anywhere in the input file.
<p>

When length units are implied in the input for sizes and dimensions,
it is only important that all implied units be consistent but not what
unit is implied.

<dl>
  <dt> <tt><b>geometry</b></tt> (required once)
       <p>
  <dd> This required input block is only necessary when defining a
       geometry using the <tt><a href=#dimension>dimension</a></tt>
       input block, but may always be included.  It should only occur
       once.  This input block takes a single argument which must be
       one of the following:
       <p>
       
       <center>
       <tt>point | rectangular | cylindrical | spherical | torus</tt>
       </center>
       <p>
       
       This input block should not be terminated.
       <p>
       
       If using the <tt><a href=#dimension>dimension</a></tt> input block to define the
       geometry and the type is <tt>torus</tt>, the
       <tt><a href=#major_radius>major_radius</a></tt> input block is required and the
       <tt><a href=#minor_radius>minor_radius</a></tt> block may also be required.
       <p>

  <dt> <a name=dimension><hr><pr></a>
       <tt><b>dimension</b></tt> (required [<a href=#note1>1</a>]:
       once [1d], twice [2d], thrice [3d])
       <p>
       
  <dd> This input block is used to define the geometry layout, and
       should be included once for each dimension needed in the
       problem.  The dimension block's first element indicates which
       dimension is being defined and should be one of the following:
       <p>
       
       <center>
       <tt> x | y | z | r | theta | phi</tt>
       </center>
       <p>
       
       <b>ALARA</b> will check to ensure that only dimensions relevant
       to the defined geometry are included.  For example, defining
       the '<tt>x</tt>' dimension in a spherical problem will generate
       an error.
       <p>
       
       The dimension block's next element is the first zone's lower
       boundary, expressed as a floating point number.  This is
       followed by a list of pairs, one pair for each zone: an integer
       specifying the number of intervals in this zone in this
       dimension and a floating point number indicating the zone's
       upper boundary. This list is terminated with the <tt>end</tt>
       keyword.
       <p>
       
       Since this method of defining the geometry calculates the the
       fine mesh intervals' zone membership and volume from the
       <tt><a href=#dimension>dimension</a></tt> data, it is
       incompatible with the <tt><a href=#volumes>volumes</a></tt>
       input block.  Including both will generate an error message.
       <p>

  <dt> <a name=minor_radius><a name=major_radius><hr><p></a></a>
       <b><tt>major_radius</tt></b> and <b><tt>minor_radius</tt></b>
       (required once [each] for <tt>geometry torus</tt>)
       <p>

  <dd> These two input blocks are used to define the major and minor
       radii of toroidal geometries.  They are only needed if defining
       a toroidal geometry with
       <tt><a href=#dimension>dimension</a></tt> input blocks, and
       each should only be included once.  Furthermore, if the minor
       radius dimension is defined with a
       <tt><a href=#dimension>dimension</a></tt> block,
       the <tt>minor_radius</tt> input block is not required.  In
       both cases, these input blocks have a fixed size, with a single
       argument specifying the radius as a floating point number.
       <p>

  <dt> <a name=volumes><hr><p></a>
       <tt><b>volumes</b></tt> (required [<a href=#note1>1</a>] once)
       <p>

  <dd> This input block is used to define the fine mesh intervals'
       volumes and zone membership.  This block can be used instead of
       the <tt><a href=#dimension>dimension</a></tt> method of
       defining the geometry.  If both are used, an error will result.
       This block should only occur once.  Multiple occurrences will
       result in undefined behavior.
      <p>
       
       This input block should be a list of pairs, one pair for each
       interval.  Each pair consists of a floating point value for the
       volume of that interval and the symbolic name of the zone
       containing that interval.  These symbolic names should
       correspond with the symbolic names given to the zones in the
       <tt><a href=#mat_loading>mat_loading</a></tt> input block.
       This list must be terminated with the keyword <tt>end</tt>.
       <p>

  <dt> <a name=mat_loading><hr><p></a>
       <tt><b>mat_loading</b></tt> (required once)
       <p>

  <dd> This input block is used to indicate which mixtures are
       contained in each zone.  This block is a list with one pair of
       entries for every zone.  Each pair consists of a symbolic name
       for the zone and a symbolic name for the mixture contained in
       that zone.  This list is terminated by the keyword
       <tt>end</tt>.  This block should only occur once.  Multiple
       occurrences will result in undefined behaviour.
       <p>
       
       If the geometry is defined using the
       <tt><a href=#dimension>dimension</a></tt> input
       blocks, there number of zones defined here must match the
       number of zones defined in the
       <tt><a href=#dimension>dimension</a></tt> blocks exactly; if
       not, an error results.  If the
       <tt><a href=#volumes>volumes</a></tt> method is used to define
       the geometry, this block uniquely determines the number of
       zones.  The symbolic name for the mixture must match one of the
       <tt><a href=#mixture>mixture</a></tt> definitions exactly, or
       be the keyword '<tt>void</tt>', indicating that this zone is
       empty of material.
       <p>

  <dt> <a name=mixture><hr><p></a>
       <tt><b>mixture</b></tt> (required: once per defined mixture)
       <p>

  <dd> This kind of block is used to define the composition of a
       mixture.  This block can occur as many times as necessary to
       define all the mixture compositions in the problem.  Any
       mixtures that are defined, but not used in the problem will
       generate a warning and be removed from the list of mixtures.
       <p>

       The first element of a <tt><a href=#mixture>mixture</a></tt>
       block is the symbolic name used to refer to this mixture
       elsewhere in the input file.  Following this is a list of
       entries with one entry for each mixture constituent.  The
       list must be terminated with the keyword '<tt>end</tt>'.
       The first element of each entry describes the type of that
       constituent and should be one of:
       <p>
       <center>
       <tt>material | element | like | target</tt>
       </center>
       <p>

       The remaining elements in each entry are interpreted as
       follows, based on this first element:
       <p>

       <dl>
	 <dt><tt>material</tt>
	 <dd> This entry has three additional elements.  The second
	      element in this entry is the symbolic name of a material
	      definition existing in the material library.  The third
	      element is a floating point value representing the
	      relative density of this material, based on the density
	      given in the material library.  The final element is a
	      floating point value representing the volume fraction of
	      this material in this mixture.  Both of the last two
	      values are typically between 0 and 1.
	      <p>

	      The purpose of these values is quite distinct and should
	      correspond to the physical system being modelled.  Their
	      proper use will ensure that the detailed output is
	      correctly normalized. For example, if a user wishes to
	      model a region containing 50% SiC, where the SiC has
	      been manufactured at 95% of theoretical density.  The
	      relative density element should by 0.95 and the volume
	      fraction element should be 0.50.
	      <p>
	      
	 <dt> <tt>element</tt>
	 <dd> This entry has three additional elements.  The second
	      element in this entry is the element's <i>modified</i>
	      chemical symbol.  This element will be expanded into a
	      list of isotopes using the abundances found in the
	      element library for that modified chemcial symbol. A
	      modified chemical symbol has the format
	      ``ZZ:XXXXXX...'', where ZZ is the standard chemical
	      symbol, and the string XXXXXX... allows for isotopic
	      abundances different from natural abundances.
	      <p>
	      
	      The final two elements of this section are identical to
	      the final two elements of the <tt>material</tt> type
	      entry, and should be interpreted in the same way.
	      <p>

	 <dt> <tt>like</tt>
	 <dd> This type of entry has two additional elements and is
	      provided as a convenience and indicates that this
	      constituent is like another user-defined mixture, with a
	      potentially different density.  The second element of
	      this entry is the symbolic name of another mixture
	      definition.  If the other mixture definition is not
	      found, an error will result.  The entry's final element
	      is a relative density, used to normalize the density as
	      defined in that mixture's own definition.  This might be
	      used when a user-defined mixture makes up part of
	      another mixture.  [Hint: it is permissible to define a
	      mixture that is not used in any zones, but only used as
	      part of another mixture.]
	      <p>
	      
	 <dt> <tt>target</tt>
	 <dd> This type of entry is used to initiate a reverse
	      calculation (see the <b>ALARA</b> Technical Manual) and
	      define the target isotopes for the reverse calculation.
	      The user can define an arbitrary number of target
	      isotopes.  The second element of this entry is one of
	      the keywords <tt>element</tt> or <tt>isotope</tt>,
	      indicating what kind of target this is.  The final
	      element is the symbolic name of either the
	      <tt>element</tt> or <tt>isotope</tt>.  For isotopes, the
	      symbolic name is in the format ZZ-AAA, where ZZ is the
	      chemical symbol and AAA is the mass number.  There are
	      no elements representing relative densities or volume
	      fractions.  If a target is of type <tt>element</tt>, the
	      element will be expanded using the element library to
	      create a list of isotopes, but their atomic abundance is
	      irrelevant.
	      
       </dl>
       <p>
       
       Note that even if a target is defined in only one mixture, it
       will cause the whole problem to be run as a reverse problem.
       There is therefore little purpose in having mixture definitions
       without targets (such as in this example).

  <dt> <a name=solve_zones><hr></a><p>
       <tt><b>solve_zones</b></tt> (optional once)
       <p>

  <dd> This optional input block allows the user to limit which zones
       are being solved in a given calculation.  It is common for a
       user to create a single complete input file describing the
       entire geometry/composition, and want to include only certain
       parts of the geometry/composition for particular cases.
       <p>

       This input consists of a list of symbolic names of the zones
       that are to be solved in this case.  These symbolic names
       should correspond with the symbolic names given to the zones in
       the <tt><a href=#mat_loading>mat_loading</a></tt> input block.
       This list must be terminated with the keyword <tt>end</tt>.

  <dd> This optional input block allows the user to limit which zones
       are being solved in a given calculation (see
       <tt><a href=#solve_zones>solve_zones</a></tt>).  It is common
       for a user to create a single complete input file describing
       the entire geometry/composition, and want to exclude certain
       parts of the geometry/composition for particular cases.
       <p>

       This input consists of a list of symbolic names of the zones
       that are <i>NOT</i> to be solved in this case.  These symbolic
       names should correspond with the symbolic names given to the
       zones in the <tt><a href=#mat_loading>mat_loading</a></tt>
       input block.  This list must be terminated with the keyword
       <tt>end</tt>.

<center><h3>Flux Schedules &amp; Chain-building</h3></center>

<dl>
  <dt> <hr><p>
       <tt><b>flux</b></tt> (required: once per defined flux)
       <p>

  <dd> This input block defines a set of flux spectra.  Since
       different parts of the irradiation history can have different
       flux spectra, this block may occur as many times as necessary
       to represent all the different necessary flux definitions.  The
       first element of this block is a symbolic name, used to refer
       to this flux spectra definition.  The other elements of this
       block are a filename, a floating point scalar normalization, an
       integer skip value (see below), and flux type indicator string,
       respectively.
       <p>

       The flux filename should indicate which file contains this flux
       information, including path information appropriate to find the
       file from the directory in which <b>ALARA</b> will be run.
       <p>
       
       The flux file itself contains a simple list of group fluxes for
       each of the fine mesh intervals defined in the problem.  The
       number of groups for each interval and the order of those
       groups is determined entirely by the data library being used.
       <b>ALARA</b> places no restrictions or assumptions on these.  Blank
       lines are ignored in the input, and may be used to separate the
       entries for each interval.
       <p>
       
       The scalar normalization permits uniform flux scaling at all
       spatial points (as opposed to the
       <tt><a href=#spatial_norm>spatial_norm</a></tt> information
       in the next section).  All groups of all fluxes in this
       definition will be multiplied by this value.
       <p>
       
       The skip value indicates how many N-group flux entries to skip
       in this file before reading the first flux.  This permits the
       user to have one file with many different flux spectra.  For
       example, if the schedule requires two different flux spectra
       for N different fine mesh points, the data for the first one
       may be at the beginning of the file, with a skip of 0, while
       the data for the second flux definition would be after these
       first fluxes, with a skip of N.
       <p>
       
       The last element is a character string indicating the flux
       file's format.  Currently the only supported format is
       <tt>default</tt>.  The default flux file format consists of one
       list of group fluxes per spatial point.  There are no other
       entries and this can be freely formatted, although comments are
       not permitted.
       <p>

       [Hint: Different flux definitions might use exactly the same
       flux values (same flux file and skip value) but a different
       scaling value.]
       <p>
       
  <dt> <a name=spatial_norm><hr><p></a>
       <tt><b>spatial_norm</b></tt> (optional once)
       <p>

  <dd> This input block allows the user to specify a scalar flux
       normalization for each fine mesh interval, such as might be
       required to re-normalize the results of a transport calculation
       on an approximated geometry.  The number of normalizations must
       be at least as many as the number of defined intervals,
       regardless of how the intervals are defined (
       <tt><a href=#dimension>dimension</a></tt> vs.
       <tt><a href=#volumes>volumes</a></tt>).  If there are too few,
       an error will result; if there are too many, a warning will
       result.
       <p>
       
       This block consists of a list of floating point normalization
       values, one value for each interval, and requires the
       <tt>end</tt> keyword to terminate the list.
       <p>
       
       [Hint: if these values are purely a function of problem

  <dt> <a name=schedule><hr><p></a>
       <tt><b>schedule</b></tt> (required: once per defined schedule)
       <p>

  <dd> This kind of block is used to define a single schedule in the
       full irradiation history hierarchy.  Since the hierarchy may be
       composed of many schedules, this block might occur many times.
       The first element in this input block is a symbolic name by
       which this schedule can be referred to.  Following this is a
       list of items occurring in this schedule.  There are two
       possible types for each item, and their may be an arbitrary
       list of items in a schedule.  This list must be terminated with
       the keyword '<tt>end</tt>'.  Since schedules can become
       complicated, a tutorial is available for forming complex
       schedules.
       <p>
      
       The first type of item is a simple pulse and the entries for
       this kind of item are a floating point operating time, a single
       character defining the units of that operating time, a symbolic
       flux name, a symbolic pulsing definition name, a floating point
       post-item delay time, and a single character defining the units
       of that delay time.
       <p>
       
       The second type of item is a sub-schedule and the entries for
       this kind of item are a symbolic name for the sub-schedule, a
       symbolic pulsing definition name, a floating point post-item
       delay time, and a single character defining the units of that
       delay time.
       <p>
       
       In both cases, if the symbolically named items (flux, pulsing
       definition, or schedule) are not found during
       cross-referencing, an error results.
       <p>

  <dt> <a name=pulsehistory><hr><p></a>
       <tt><b>pulsehistory</b></tt> (required: once per defined history)
       <p>

  <dd> This kind of input block defines the multi-level pulsing
       histories referenced in the
       <tt><a href=#schedule>schedule</a></tt> definitions.  The
       tutorial on forming complex schedules includes more details on
       pulsing histories.  Since many different pulsing histories may
       be used throughout the hierarchy of schedules, this block may
       occur many times.
       <p>
       
       The first element of each block is a symbolic name for
       referring to this pulsing schedule.  Following this is a list
       of pulsing level definition triplets, each consisting of an
       integer number of pulses, a floating point delay time between
       pulses, and a single character defining the units of that delay
       time.  Since an arbitrary number of pulsing levels is allowed,
       this list must be terminated with the keyword '<tt>end</tt>'.
       <p>

  <dt> <a name=truncation><hr><p></a>
       <tt><b>truncation</b></tt> (required once)
       <p>

  <dd> This fixed sized input block defines the primary parameter used
       in truncating the activation trees.  See the <b>ALARA</b>
       Technical Manual for a detailed discussion of the tree
       truncation issue.  The only element of this block is the
       truncation tolerance.  When testing the relative atom loss (or
       relative production in reverse calculations), any value higher
       than the truncation tolerance will result in continuing the
       tree while lower values will result in truncation.
       <p>

  <dt> <a name=impurity><hr><p></a>
       <tt><b>impurity</b></tt> (optional once)
       <p>

  <dd> This fixed sized input block defines the parameters used to
       treat initial isotopes as impurities.  This feature allows the
       user to build shorter chains for impurities, since their
       contributions tend to be less significant.  This can make
       <b>ALARA</b> run much faster when impurities with very large
       cross-sections are present.  The first element of this block is
       a floating point number defining the threshold for treating an
       isotope as an impurity.  This value is a relative concentration
       within a mixture.  Therefore, if the user wishes to treat all
       isotopes which make up less than
       10&nbsp;atom-parts-per-million&nbsp;[appm] as impurities, they
       would enter '<tt>1e-5</tt>' for this element.  The remaining
       element is the truncation tolerance to be used for these
       impurities.  They have the same definition as given in the
       description of the <tt><a href=#truncation>truncation</a></tt>
       input block.  To make effective use of this input block, the
       value given here should be orders of magnitude larger than the
       value given in the <tt><a href=#truncation>truncation</a></tt>
       input block.
       <p>

  <dt> <a name=ignore><hr><p></a>
       <tt><b>ignore</b></tt> (optional once)
       <p>

  <dd> This optional fixed sized input block defines an additional
       parameter used in truncating the activation trees.  See the
       <b>ALARA</b> Technical Manual for a detailed discussion of the
       tree truncation issue.  The only element of this block is the
       a <i>relative</i> ignore tolerance.  When truncating chains, if
       the value is also lower than the <i>absolute</i> ignore
       tolerance, that node is completely ignored.  The
       <i>absolute</i> ignore tolerance is calculated by multiplying
       by the <tt><a href=#truncation>truncation</a></tt> tolerance
       (or the <tt><a href=#impurity>impurity</a></tt> trucnation
       tolerance, as appropriate) by this value.  When this input is
       not include, a relative ignore tolerance of 10<sup>-2</sup> is
       used - that is, a relative production 100 times lower than the
       truncation tolerance.

<dl>
       
  <dt> <hr><p>
       <tt><b>cooling</b></tt> (optional once)
       <p>

  <dd> This input block is used to define the after-shutdown cooling
       times at which the problem will be solved.  Multiple
       occurrences will result in undefined behavior.  This block is
       simply a list of times, where each time consists of a floating
       point time followed by a single character defining the time's
       units.  Since an arbitrary number of cooling times can be
       solved, this list must be terminated with the keyword
       '<tt>end</tt>'.
       <p>

  <dt> <a name=output><hr><p></a>
       <tt><b>output</b></tt> (optional: once per required output definiton)
       <p>

  <dd> This kind of input block allows the user to define the output's
       resolution and format.  The first element of an output format
       block indicates the resolution and should be one of:
       <p>

       <center>
       <tt> interval | zone | mixture </tt>
       </center>
       <p>
       
       This is followed by a list of output types and modifiers
       described in the following table:
       <p>
       
       <center>
       <table border=1 cellpadding=5>

       <p>
       
       The <tt>units</tt> output modifier is used to perform unit
       conversion on the output and requires two additional text
       parameters.  The first parameter is defines the units for
       specific activity and related output types and has two
       possibilities:
       <p>
       
       <center>
       <tt> Ci | Bq </tt>
       </center>
       <p>
       
       representing "Curies" and "Bequerel" respectively.  The
       second parameter defines the units for normalization (typically
       volumetric vs. mass).  This parameter has four possibilities:
       <p>
       
       <center>
       <tt>cm3 | m3 | g | kg </tt>
       </center>
       <p>
       
       The <tt>wdr</tt> output modifier requires an additional text
       string parameter representing the filename to use for
       calculating the waste disposal rating or clearance limits.
       A detailed description of the WDR file is available here.  To
       calculate the WDR based on different standards, simply repeat
       this modifier within a single <tt>output</tt> block, using
       different WDR filenames each time.  Be sure that the
       <tt>units</tt> modifier defines units that correspond to those
       in the WDR file.
       <p>
       
       See the section on Output File Formats for detailed for
       information on interpreting the output files generated by
       <b>ALARA</b>.
       <p>

  <dt> <a name=material_lib><a name=element_lib><hr><p></a></a>
       <tt><b>material_lib</b></tt> and <tt><b>element_lib</b></tt>
       (required once [each])
       <p>

  <dd> These two input blocks are used to specify the libraries to be
       used for looking up the definitions of materials and elements
       when they are given as <tt><a href=#mixture>mixture</a></tt>
       constituents.  Each block has a single element consisting of
       the filename to be used in each case, including appropriate
       path information to find that file from the directory where
       <b>ALARA</b> is being run.  For more information on the format
       of these libraries, see the section on Support Files.
       <p>

  <dt> <a name=dump_file><hr><p></a>
       <tt><b>dump_file</b></tt> (optional once)
       <p>

  <dd> This input block defines the filename to use for the binary
       data dump produced during a run of <b>ALARA</b>.  This is
       currently used to store the intermediate results during the
       calculation, and will be extended in the future to allow
       sophisticated post-processing of the data.  This filename
       should be a valid name for a new file, including path
       information appropriate for the directory where <b>ALARA</b>
       will be run.  Note that if the dump file already exists, it
       will be overwritten with no warning.  If this input block is
       omitted, the default name '<tt>alara.dump</tt>' will be used.

  <dt> <a name=data_library><hr><p></a>
       <tt><b>data_library</b></tt>
       <p>

  <dd> This input block is used to define the type and location of the
       nuclear data library.  The first element of this block is
       character string defining the type of library.  The subsequent
       elements indicate the file's location.  Currently accepted
       library types are:
       <p>
       
       <dl>
	 <dt> <tt>alaralib</tt> - Standard <b>ALARA</b> v2.x binary library
	 <dd> This library type requires a single filename indicating
	      the library's location.
	      <p>
	 <dt> <tt>adjlib</tt> - Standard <b>ALARA</b> v2.x reverse library
	 <dd> This library type requires a single filename indicating
	      the library's location.
	      <p>
	 <dt> <tt>eaflib</tt> - Data library following EAF formatting
	      conventions (ENDF/B).
	 <dd> This library type requires two filenames, the
	      transmutation library and the decay library,
	      respectively.  These libraries will be read and
	      processed, creating an <b>ALARA</b> v2.x binary library
	      with the name '<tt>alarabin</tt>' for use in subsequent
	      calculations.  Alternatively, this library could be
	      converted to an <b>ALARA</b> v2.x binary library as a
	      separate process using the
	      <tt><a href=#convert_lib>convert_lib</a></tt> function.
       </dl>
       <p>
       
       For both types of <b>ALARA</b> v2.x library, the extension
       ".lib" will be added to the filename indicated in this input
       block.  Otherwise, all filenames should include appropriate
       path information to find the file from the directory in which
       <b>ALARA</b> will be run.
       <p>

  <dt> <a name=convert_lib><hr><p></a>
       <tt><b>convert_lib</b></tt>
       <p>

  <dd> This input block is used to convert library formats.  If this
       input block is included, <b>ALARA</b> will stop immediately
       after converting the library (ie. it should not be used as part
       of a normal <b>ALARA</b> input file).
       <p>
       
       The first two elements of this input block indicated the
       original library format and the desired new format,
       respectively.  The following values are allowable:
       <p>
       
       <dl>
	 <dd> <tt>alaralib</tt> - Standard <b>ALARA</b> v2.x binary library
	 <dd> <tt>adjlib</tt> - Standard <b>ALARA</b> v2.x reverse library
	 <dd> <tt>eaflib</tt> - Data library following EAF formatting
	      conventions (ENDF/B).
       </dl>
       <p>

       The number and nature of the subsequent elements depend on
       these first two elements, but are divided into two sections.
       The first section is dependent on the first element (the
       original library format) and the second section is dependent on
       the second element (the desired library format):
       <p>
       
       <dl>
	 <dt> <tt>alaralib</tt>
	 <dd> This section has a single element, the base name of the
	      <b>ALARA</b> v2.x libraries to be generated.  Four (4)
	      files will be created with the following extensions:
	      <dl>
		<dd><tt>.lib</tt> - the binary reaction library
		<dd><tt>.idx</tt> - a copy of the reaction index which
		     is included in the binary reaction library
		<dd><tt>.gam</tt> - the binary gamma source library
		     (coming soon!)
		<dd><tt>.gdx</tt> - a copy of the gamma source index
		     which is included in the binary gamma source
		     library
	      </dl>
	      <p>
	      
	 <dt> <tt>adjlib</tt>
	 <dd> This section has a single element, the base name of the
	      <b>ALARA</b> v2.x reverse libraries to be generated.
	      Two (2) files will be created with the following
	      extensions:
	      <dl>
		<dd><tt>.lib</tt> - the binary reverse reaction
		     library
		<dd><tt>.idx</tt> - a copy of the reverse reaction

	      </dl>
	      <p>
	      
	 <dt> <tt>eaflib</tt>
	 <dd> This section requires two elements, the filenames
