POST-PROCESSOR
----------------
(see newFileFormat for partial context)

A post-processing tool would have to be substantial in scope,
including the following capabilities:
	* read original input file
	* data-structures to provide database like navigation of data
	  with various keys
	* decay chain calculations for results at various cooling
	  times
In fact, other than the decay chain calculations, this will really be
more like a database than anything else!
