This directory is the default location to find data for ALARA.  In
addition to placing processed transmutation and decay data here, it is
the main location to find other data including the default element
library, a sample material library, and all the data required for the
different responses (waste disposal ratings, contact dose, etc).

FetterHi         FetterC_hi.Ci_m3.wdr       Waste disposal limits based on the
                                            values proposed by Fetter, and
                                            using the high value where ranges
                                            are given instead of single values.
                                            The units are Ci/m^3.

                                            using the low value where ranges
                                            are given instead of single values.

NOTE: For all clearance files, if accessed by the short name, the default behavior will
      be to reference the newest data.
