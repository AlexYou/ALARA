begin a new implemetation for getting mim tree w/ given kza
now start using a tree data structure
9/03
merging the tree data structure with the existing TreeFile class (done)
9/12
fix ui so it doesn't crash w/ unhappy input
goal:
have IO.java handle all the output and input
1 promt for string 
1 promt for int
1 prompt for menuoption
//maybe direct output to a file as well
and also make a reduced ui
9/20/02
-powermode is implemented
ui is fixed well
ui doesn't crash w/ undsire type of input anymore
for menus switches
case -1 is to switch back to normal mode
case 0 is to switch to powermode
-view as table now adds option for number of lines displayed
-read bin file now shows the percent of data to be read
9/23/02
try to find a way to show the table names....
-got it, it's implemented int viewData.java
-showing data as table now has the option to stop in the middle
treeTableDB's contructor now checks for exiting table
if the table exist the user have the option
to name another table or use the existn one
if the table did not exist the table will be created
-read in file now checks if the file exist 
9/25/2002
the original treetabledb constructor creates a table
when using treeTabledb, we don't always want to create a tatle
so now creating a new project and make change to 
treetabledb
-Because it's not alway the case that when creating an object
of TreeTableDB a new table must to be made, therefore
a new consturctor is implemented just to take connection
as a parameter.
A New method selectTable is alway impleamted
if no table is selected when the object of treetabledb is created
then can use selectTable to select table
and because the code is repeated, the original
consturctor( that takes table name and conn as param) nose
uses selectTable to determine if there is already
a table w/ the same name
-now checks if a particular tables exist before proceeding
in both viewChainw/KZA and also viewMinTreew/KZA
-in both viewChainw/KZA and also viewMinTreew/KZA
if the particular kza doesn't exit, it won't crash anymore
9/26/02
done merging code 
####### NEW #######
8/05
new file tree_ds.java - the tree data structure
8/16!!
getMinTree w/ given kza finally works the new Tree implementation
9/23/02
added showTables in viewData
9/25/02
new constructor in TreeTableDB
new method selectTable in TreeTableDB
###### CHANGE ######
8/13
take out quick sort from viewData
change the sql command in TreeTableDB::getKza so it gets the 
TreeData already sorted by kza DSCE
8/17
change the try clause in InOut::connectDBServer
9/23/02
take away toString in viewData and use regular 
System.out.print
###### PEDDING #####
replace vector use w/ tree (9/12)
mark ** for the given kza
