RESEARCH
------------------
* data infrastructure [MF]
* investigate round-off error issues in bateman and inversion methods


NOTES
--------
*********************** ROUND-OFF ERROR ********************
Note that bateman(...) and laplaceInverse(...) currently take the
absolute value of negative results, which is only valid when assuming
that they are inconsequential.  This is a source of numerical error!!!
but a positive wrong answer is better than a negative wrong answer.
