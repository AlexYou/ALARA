ALARA was initially written as part of Paul Wilson's PhD project at
the University of Wisconsin-Madison, with the support of the Nuclear
Engineering and Engineering Physics Department, the Fusion Technology
Institute and the U.S. Department of Energy.  In particular,
Professors Doug Henderson, Jake Blanchard and Gerald Kulcinski played
important roles in the completion of this work.

Many others were responsible for offering regular feedback and impetus
for improvements in both the capabities and the quality of the
software:

Charles Maynard (UW, NEEP Professor)
Douglass Henderson (UW, NEEP Professor)
Ulrich Fischer (FZK, INR/IRS)
Cheng-Wei Wu (UW, NEEP Grad)
Qing-Ming Wang (UW, NEEP Grad)
James Sisolak (UW, NEEP Grad)
Tim Tautges (SNL)
Igor Golovkin (UW, FTI Post-doc)
Greg Moses (UW, NEEP Professor)
Greg Rochau (UW, NEEP Grad)

Some additional people have worked more closely with the project in
the following ways:
