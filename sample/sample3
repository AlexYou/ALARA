geometry cylindrical

## Note that the dimention setting (r) corresponds to the geometry type (cylindrical)
dimension	r

	1	10.0
	2	15.0

## The mixtures may be made up of pre-defined materials, elements, or a combination of the two
mixture	inner_mix
	material CONC		1.0	0.05
	material b4c		1.0	0.25
	element  ni		1.0	0.70

flux  flux_1  data/fluxin2   1e6   0  default


## The flux is applied for one second with no delay (the delay is applied in the pulsehistory command)
schedule  total
	1 s  flux_1  pulsed_spec  0 s
end

## The schedule defined above is applied ten (10) times with a five (5) second delay between each pulse
pulsehistory  pulsed_spec
        10   5 s
