Thank you for your interest in ALARA.

Please see the INSTALL file for generic details on building and
installing packages using 'configure' and 'make'.

Some test/sample files are included in directory './sample'.  They can
all be run in succession, with output stored in a directory
"sample_out" by executing the script:
%> cd sample
%> ./run_samples.sh sample_out
A reference set of output is available in directory ./sample/ref_out.

In addition to building and installing the ALARA program, this package
includes an accessory program, dant2alara, and a pair of Perl scripts
for post-processing data.

dant2alara...
...is an interactive program for converting RTFLUX/ATFLUX files (from
DANTSYS and similar) to text based flux files for use in ALARA.  Since
ALARA can read RTFLUX files directly, this use may not be useful.  On
the other hand, the biological dose method requires ggamma source to
dose conversion factors from an ATFLUX type file, which can not be
handled directly by ALARA at this time.

extract_pathways...
.... is a Perl script that scans an ASCII tree file and finds all the
chains/pathways that result in a given isotope.

summary ....
... is a Perl script that extracts a summary of the output file, most
notably removing all results for individual isotopes and leaving all
totals.  You can also extract results for a single specific isotopes
by giving the argument "-iso" followed by the isotope in question
written as a lower case atomic symbol hyphenated with the mass
number. e.g. tritium is h-3.
