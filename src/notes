INPUT
-----
* handling of component density: number vs. mass, etc....

CHAIN
-----

* 'parent' of each root isotope must be set to NULL

* DONE * When tallying a chain, it will be necessary to figure out how many
	 nodes up the chain must be tallied.  While doing this, change the
	 state to FINISHED.


TODO:
------

* DONE * allow included input file segments: implemented as a FILO 
         stack of input file stream references

* separate out the ALARA v1 binary format dependent stuff from the
  ASCIILib class

* DONE * make sure that loopRank[n] is not lower than loopRank[m<n] : if so,
	 there is a loop in the middle.


* add the possibility to set the width of the output

* handling of void zones ????
